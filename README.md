# weather-dashboard

This application allows for a user to check the daily and 5 Day Forecast of a city the user input into the search bar. The user will see the current weather, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index in that given city. The UV Index will have a color code alerting the user if the index is low, moderate or high. Below this information the user can see the 5 Day Forecast with the temperature and humidity displayed. The user will be able to insert multiple cities and still be able to access the cities previously viewed and their information. 

This assignments difficulty, for me, really layed in what approach I wanted for the html along with which API(s) I wanted to use. The original plan was to use the current and 5 Day Forecast API, so I started my code but after some time and research I saw the One Call API and thought that would be an easier API to use. After writing out a decent amount of code I realized I preferred the other format I had better. Doing this took up a lot of time and therefore did not allow for me to finalize some aspects in the final deployed site. For example, when the user opens the site, you can see the divs for the current and 5 Day Forecast. Overall I am satisfied enough with the product I have but will go back and work on perfecting the site once I have a grade on this assignment.
